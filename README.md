This has been made in around 90 minutes and is not an actual game, but a prototyp. It is hard to control on purpose and is meant to be entertaining and frustrating at the same time. 

Controls:
- Hold down 'W' to fly upwards
- A and D to fly sidewards
- Move the mouse forward and backward to tilt the player
- Moving the mouse sideward has no benefit, but is making it harder
